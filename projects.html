                    <h2>Traveling Salesman Problem</h2>
                    <p>Implemented the arbitrary insertion heuristic to quickly find a path. Using this path and cost, I created another function that generates permutations on this path. With the branch and bound algorithm and Prim's algorithm for creating a minimum spanning tree, I found the most optimal path that minimizes path cost.</p>

                    <h2>Relational Database Emulator</h2>
                    <p>Implemented a simplified version of SQL to provide an interface for efficient data retrieval. Also efficiently optimized runtime and memory tradeoffs for various database functions such as retrieval, table joins, and data insertion using various data structures such as hash tables.</p>

                    <h2>Piazza Post Classifier</h2>
                    <p>Implemented a program that analyzes the content of student Piazza posts to classify them into categories by calculating the logarithmic probability of posts to belong to certain categories to automatically classify. Also could also predict never-seen before posts through machine learning and training the algorithm with datasets.</p>

                    <h2>Image Resizing Via Seam Carving</h2>
                    <p>Implemented a program that can resize input image files through seam carving to output edited images. Mathematically calculated the most optimal and cheapest seam to remove by comparing the costs to remove the lowest total energy pixels.</p>
